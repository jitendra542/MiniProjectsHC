                    <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at Anand International College of
                        Engineering, I'm engaged as an intern with Apna College, harnessing my proficiency in data
                        structures and algorithms using Java. My education is complemented by practical experience at
                        Learn and Build, where problem-solving in technical environments has been a core focus. Skills
                        in Linux and HTML5 further define my technical acumen.

                        The internships have offered me a platform to apply academic knowledge to real-world scenarios,
                        enhancing our team's capabilities in developing efficient solutions. With the help of
                        certifications from prestigious institutes like IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bombay, I've contributed
                        to fostering an environment of continuous learning and innovation. I am motivated to bring
                        diverse perspectives to the team, keen to align my growth with the organization's long-term
                        vision.</p>
